## 🚀 Our Moonshot: Amplifying Human Intelligence

Noos isn't just another note-taking app. It's a vision for a world where:
- Knowledge is fluid, interconnected, and democratically owned
- AI assists without controlling
- Individual sovereignty meets collective intelligence
- Learning transcends institutional and technological boundaries

## 🛣️ Evolutionary Roadmap

### Phase I: Windsurf IDE Extension
**Objective**: Create an intelligent knowledge management tool for developers

- 🔹 Obsidian-compatible Markdown support
- 🔹 AI-assisted note-taking
- 🔹 Project context linking
- 🔹 Basic graph visualization

### Phase II: Standalone Knowledge Platform
**Objective**: Build a universal knowledge management application

- 🔹 Cross-domain knowledge handling
- 🔹 Advanced AI recommendations
- 🔹 Sophisticated graph interactions
- 🔹 Comprehensive plugin ecosystem

### Phase III: Decentralized Collective Intelligence
**Objective**: Create a global, sovereign knowledge network

- 🔹 Holochain-powered distributed architecture
- 🔹 Peer-to-peer knowledge sharing
- 🔹 Cryptographically secure interactions
- 🔹 Ethical, user-controlled AI

## 🤝 Community Invitation

### We Need Your Brainpower! 🧠

Noos is more than a project—it's a collaborative movement. We're seeking:
